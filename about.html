        <h1>Meet the Author:</h1>
       <p>
            My name is Winston, although, some people call me Winnie for short. I have nearly 21 years of experience (unless you count by human years, then it would be almost 3 years) in comforting humans. I try to show them the dog's point of view on how to maintain happiness and acheive a healthy mental state. I'm a strong advisor for meditation, cuddling, and naps. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my humans, playing with my ball, eating treats, and going to the beach.
